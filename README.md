# batchful
A simple and easy-to use python directory organizer. 

No installation needed -- just run the `.py` / `.exe` file in the desired folder.

## Usage
Paste the program in the directory you wish to organize and run it.

### Configuration
There are currently two implemented methods of organization *(more coming soon -- see below)*: 
1. By file extension: creates a directory for every filetype and sorts the files accordingly. 
2. By file name: creates a directory for a spacefic phrase and moves all of the files containing the phrase to the directory.

You will also be presented with the option to sort through subfolders.
This process deletes the unnecessary folders after it's done sorting.

Press the button with the desired function to start.

## Coming Soon
- Better GUI
