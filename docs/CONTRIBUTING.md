# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the batchful project. It's people like you that help shape batchful into such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of us, the developers managing and developing this project. In return, we should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

With batchful being an open-source project, we love to receive contributions from the community. There are numerous ways to contribute, from improving the documentation and submitting bug report to requesting features or writing code which can be incorporated to the batchful itself.
Feel free to fork or PR our code -- this only helps batchful grow larger.

# Ground Rules
* Ensure cross-distro & cross-DE compatibility for every change you make. Some utilites only come in a package, and some simply aren't supported in certain distros.
* Try to introduce the as few new dependencies as possible. Again, not every distribution supports every tool, and building from source is a headache.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get feedback from the developers and the community.
* When making a Pull Request, clearly mention every change done to the code for easier digestion into the main branch.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? Issues are a great place to start, because they teach you the basics of contribution as well as solving a fellow user's problem.
Search for these labels:
* **good first issue** - issues which should be simple enough to solve
* **help wanted** - issues which require some extra attention

If you don't feel inclined to assist with technical issues, or if you have some time on your hands, you could search for duplicate issues. We will be infinitely grateful.

Of course, one of the most effective ways to directly contribute to the project is by making a Pull Request. GitHub has an excellent series all about contributing to open-source projects. [Check it out](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first!

**If you feel like supporting the project without contributing to it, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/embersandsgamestudios) for a one-time donation of one dollar. Thank you for your support.**


# How to report a bug
If you find a serious exploit or security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email `security@sfr.anonaddy.com` instead.
*I know this sounds unlikely when talking about offline file sorting software, but still.*

Before reporting a bug, use GitHub's search tool to see if you're alone. You probably aren't.

When filing a bug report, please fill out the issue template provided. In short, it should look something like this:
> * Description of the bug
> * Steps to reproduce
> * Expected behaviour
> * Screenshots
> * Environment details (*e.g.* Debian 10.0, GNOME, Radeon RX550)
> * Additional context

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in batchful, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

**DISCLAIMER:** Not all feature requests will be added to the project. Some of them simply don't fit our view of what batchful should have, and we don't want it to feel bloated and heavy. Being an GPLv3-licensed open-source project, you're free to fork it and add whichever additions suit your needs. 

When filing a feature request, please fill out the issue template provided.
# Code review process
[3174N](https://github.com/3174N), the Python branch's maintainer, regularly looks at Pull Requests, trying to help flesh out the PR and merge it. Pull Requests may be closed after a month has passed with no new activity.
